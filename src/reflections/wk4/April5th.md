<b>What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?</b>

Callback Hell is created by writing messy and long code. It creates a pyramid shap on the side of your page and is hard to read. 

<b>What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?</b>

Asynchronous means "takes some time". In regards to callbacks, it means that the callback doesn't return right away.

<b>Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell.</b>

1. Keep your code simple. Simple code is cleaner and easier to read.

2. Create modules for each small task and assemble them into a bigger module for a bigger task.

3. Handle your errors.
