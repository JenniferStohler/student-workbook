<b>What are the three states of a Promise?</b>

Pending - the initial state, before the promise succeeds/fails.

Resolved- Promise succeeds.

Rejection- Promise fails.

<b>How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?</b>

Promises use a process called Chaining. Chaining ties together all async operations
and passes them, making the code look cleaner and easier to read.

<b>What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?</b>

The '.then()' is the action that is done after a promise succeeds. The '.catch()' is used when a promise fails and is followed by the '.then()' method.
