<b>What is the purpose of a Query String?</b>

A query string passes information to and from a website by adding information to the end of the URL.

<b>What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?</b>

Parameters come after the ? mark in the URL. Multiple parameters are separated by the &. Parameters are sutomatically parsed and stored in the request object. 

<b>When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?</b>

I think they tell the server what information to grab and where to grab it from.
