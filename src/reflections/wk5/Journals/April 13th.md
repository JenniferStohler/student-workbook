<b>What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?</b>

You have to consider how many of one element that you are going to put into another. The reading used an excellent example: books and genres. Many books can fit into a genre. However, books are constantly being added and removed to a genre(or genres). Therefore, it makes more sense to embed the genre into the book instead of the other way around. You can also create a third place to store the relationship of the first two. This is called Third Collection Embedding.
