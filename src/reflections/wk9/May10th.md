<b>What technologies and principles are you using in your project?</b>

We are using Vue.js, MongoDB, and Postman. We are implementing paired programming and SCRUM so that each of us knows what we are working on, what the others have worked on, and what needs to be done. 

<b>What went well so far?</b>

Planning out our site and our tasks went really well. It gave us an idea of how we want our site to look and function.

<b>What would you do differently? Why?</b>

Better communication. We all get along well, which is great, but some of us need to speak up more.
