<b>How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?</b>

Smaller teams have to expand their means of communication such as using messaging apps like Slack to communicate while working. This gets rid of unnecessary in-person meetings that would be needed with a larger team. 

<b>Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.</b>

It allows one sprint at a time because that gives a much clearer view of what priorities are the most important and allows the team to set realisitic expectations for the project. 

<b>What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?</b>

The unattainable triangle refers to the speed at which the project is done versus the quality of the project. It helps the team set realistic expectations.
