<b>Why is communication on a small team important?</b>

Communication keeps your team on track. It lets everyone know what each of them is doing, keeps the project moving along, and maps out when you are communicating and who you are communicating to. 

<b>What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?</b>

Continuous communication throughout the team in place of so many meetings allows developers to work on the project while still communicating with their team, and gets rid of unnecessary meetings that disrupt the workflow.

<b>What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?</b>

The team needs to implement the "unattainable triangle"- that Good Service means cheap won't be fast, fast won't be cheap, and cheap won't be good. This helps the team set realistic expectations of the project and set clear priorities for any given day.
