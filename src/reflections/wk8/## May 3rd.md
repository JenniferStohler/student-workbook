<b>What function does a developer Portfolio provide?</b>

The dev portfolio offers more visibility, helps you practice/improve your craft, shows your expertise, shows your background of work, and helps you stand out in an interview.

<b>What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?</b>

It shows off your skillset to employers that are interviewing you. Instead of just telling them about what you can do, you can show them, thus making you stand out from the crowd.

<b>What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?</b>

I would include my Moon Miner, TaskMaster, Inspire, Kanban, and the DnD Character Building app for Beginners that my capstone group is working on. I feel like they adequately show off my skills, what I've learned at Boise Codeworks, and how effective I am working with a group of other software developers.
