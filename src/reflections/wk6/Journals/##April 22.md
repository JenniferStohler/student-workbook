<b>What is a nested route?</b>

Components nested inside of other components.

<b>When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)</b>

When you need a component to call upon another component (like a child object referring back to its parent object). Nested routes are also useful to relationships.

<b>Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?</b>

Yes, when your main page needs subpages.
