<b>What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?</b>

Lifecycle hooks are pretty much diagramsthat allow you to see when your component is made, sent to the DOM, and/or destroyed.

<b>How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?</b>

I have sometimes drawn up a diagram for my projects to see where my data is going. However, we usually use computed properties and created properties in our projects.



<b>What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?</b>

Mounting hooks allow the developer to access their component before or after the very first render; however, they do not run in server-side rendering. Only use  mounting hooks if you need to access the DOM on your component after the first render.
