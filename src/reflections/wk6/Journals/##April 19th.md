<b>What is Component based architecture?</b>

It is a method that encapsulates pieces from a larger UI into micro-systems.

<b>What are some benefits of Component based architecture?</b>

Allows the DOM to update without the need for a page refresh. One component can refresh without affecting other components and are reuseable. Methods and APIs are all contained in one class, so developers won't need to go searching for which function goes to which part. 

<b>What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?</b>

The code can become bloated and very hard to read. Overengineering can also happen.
