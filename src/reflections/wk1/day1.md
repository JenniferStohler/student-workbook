**1. In your own words, why do we use Git?**

Git is a Open Sourced Version Control System that allows developers to store and track code. Git keeps track of what changes the developer makes in the code, thus allowing multiple developers to add and make changes to code at once. Git also has access to many different repositories, such as a remote repository (which stores code in a server) and a local repository (which stores code on a developer's computer).

**2 .What are the benefits of having multiple branches?**

Multiple branches allow multiple developments to coexist, much like how the tiny branches of a tree all stem from one big branch. All commits stem from a Master branch, and branches that stem off of commits are called Test branches. Each Test branch has a different code than the Master branch. Both codes, though different, exist side by side.   



**3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a way for developers to add, change, and keep track of their code while GitHub is a site that stores code to a system (other than the developer's computer.) GitHub is very much like the Cloud- a service where you can store content onto a system other than your computer.
