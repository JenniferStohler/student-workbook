<b>Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?</b>

We implemented the User Experience and made our projects more accessible and pleasant to look at/easy to use. We also used code documentation to help us remember what we did and what questions we had for the TAs.

<b>What went well?</b>

We had excellent flow and communication. We planned our layout and wrote a todo list, which really helped us be organized and stay on task. We also timeboxed each requirement.

<b>What would you do differently?</b>

Not much, honestly. Just switch partner programming roles a little more often.
