What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value - system creates a copy of the variable in another method.
Reference-doesn't store it's value directly. Stores it in another memory location.
Pointer-  don't inherit from object and conversions don't exist between pointers and objects. Pointers can be converted amongst themselves.

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, enum, decimal, double, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

System puts a variable in a random memory location and the location's address is stored where the actual value is stored instead of the variable itself.
