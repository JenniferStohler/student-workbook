In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?


Columns contain datatypes and column names. Rows contain data for each of the columns.

Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.

a.	CREATE TABLE characters (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
age INT NOT NULL,
description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(id)




What is the difference between the following statements:

DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

DELETE FROM just deletes one thing from the table and DROP TABLE deletes the entire table.
