What is a List in C#?

It is a generic type, so any type of list can be made.

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Add- to add an item/ variable to the list
List.Clear- to clear the list.
List.Find- to find an item in the list

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I'd use the List.FindIndex method to look at the starting index of the list and work its way down the list to the item that matches the predicate.
