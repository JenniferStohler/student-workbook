What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Strongly typed constants. They are useful whenever your code has a set of related numbers.

How can you modify an Enum?

By specifying a base as you declare the enum, or set the value of the enum member.

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

None that I remember, but I could use enum for audio. For example, if I built an application that had music playing in the background, I could use an enum to adjust the volume with Low-1, Medium-2, and High-3.
