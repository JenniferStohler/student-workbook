  Taking this course has been the most challenging, yet best decision that I have made for myself. I feel like I finally have a career goal in mind. My experience thus far has been very enriching, fun, and educational. I do struggle with grasping concepts like Vue, but that I am doing well with C# and .NET. The server stuff, to me, has a more solid structure and routine that I really appreciate and enjoy. I also enjoy the strong friendships that I have made in this course. Seriously, without my Codeworks friends and their constant encouragement, I might not have gotten this far in the cohort.

  For the final, I plan to study relationships, C#, and Vue. I also plan to timebox myself, set a coding schedule for myself, and get plenty of rest, water, food, breaks, etc. I am going to keep telling myself that I will kick this final's butt!
