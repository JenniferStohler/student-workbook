What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It ddescribes a relationship between the derived class and the base class (parent/child). It allows the sharing of code and also gives a class its identity.

How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Inheritence is transitive, meaning that one class (for example, C) inherits from the B class, which means that D also inherits from B. Think of B as the grandparent, C as the parent, and D as the child. However, not all classes inherit members of the base class. Constructors and finalizers are not inherited by the child classes.

How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private members aren't visible in child classes, PRotected members are only visible in child classes, Internal members are visible in derived classes within the parent class, and Public members dare accessible and part of the public interface of the child.
